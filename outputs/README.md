# State-level outputs
Outputs for each state are organized in the subfolders above. Within each state's subfolder, the `plots` folder contains the "training-testing" plots that are featured in the paper. In North Carolina, for instance, `NC/NC_early_later.png` was created using a threshold of `t = 0.07`, whereas `NC/NC_early_later_new.png` uses the threshold in the FTV test: `t = max(0.07, 1/k)`, where _k_ is the number of Congressional districts in the state. `NC/NC_scatter.png` is the scatterplot featured in Figure 5 in the paper.
