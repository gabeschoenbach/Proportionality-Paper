# State-level outputs
This folder contains the "training-testing" plots that are featured in the paper. The file `early_later.png` was created using a threshold of `t = 0.07`, whereas `early_later_new.png` uses the threshold in the FTV test: `t = max(0.07, 1/k)`, where _k_ is the number of Congressional districts in the state. `scatter.png` is the scatterplot featured in Figure 5 in the paper.
